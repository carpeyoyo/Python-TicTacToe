# Python-TicTacToe
A playable Tic Tac Toe game using Python, Tkinter, and Turtle.

This was designed using Python 2.7 with the Tkinter, tkMessageBox, and turtle packages. These will need to be installed before the game can be played.

This is a work in progress. Currently, the game allows two people to play Tic Tac Toe by alternating who clicks. In the future I hope to have a working AI oppenent.
