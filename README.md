# Python-TicTacToe
A playable Tic Tac Toe game using Python and Tkinter written by Joshua Mazur (carpeyoyo.github.io).

Simply run the TTT.py file to start the GUI version of the game.

This was designed using Python 2.7 with the Tkinter package. This package will need to be installed before the game can be played.

This program now has a working AI with three difficulty levels:

#### Easy

AI chooses moves randomly.

#### Medium

AI chooses moves randomly but will choose winning move if one happens to develop. Also a one in three chance that it will purposely choose to block an opponent's winning move if one exists.

#### Hard
AI uses strategy that should all result in a tie if no human mistakes are made.
